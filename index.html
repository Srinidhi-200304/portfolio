      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        This is my personal portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills 
        as a front-end developer.
        I am an aspiring Front-End Developer with a passion for crafting clean, user-friendly, and responsive web applications. My journey into development started with curiosity     design and grew into building interactive projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Along the way, I have explored frameworks and tools to enhance performance and deliver seamless user experiences. I enjoy turning ideas into functional products and believe in continuous learning to stay updated with modern web technologies. My goal is to contribute to real-world projects where I can combine creativity, problem-solving, and technical skills to create meaningful digital experiences.</p>
      <p>
Beyond coding, I value clear communication, collaboration, and attention to detail. I believe that great web development is not just about writing code, but about creating digital solutions that truly solve problems and engage users. I am eager to work on projects that challenge me to think critically, adapt quickly, and grow as a developer. Whether itâ€™s designing intuitive interfaces or optimizing performance, I aim to bring creativity and consistency to everything I build.
