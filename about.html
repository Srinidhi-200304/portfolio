        <h2>Hello! I'm Srinidhi üë©‚Äçüíª</h2>
        <p>
          I am a B.Com Computer Application graduate and an aspiring Front-End Developer 
          with a strong interest in crafting clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. 
          I enjoy working with modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring ideas 
          to life. Currently, I am expanding my portfolio and exploring new tools to kickstart 
          my career in the IT field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I have developed a strong interest in creating digital experiences that are not only functional but also visually engaging. I enjoy experimenting with layouts, colors, and interactive elements to make websites stand out while remaining user-friendly. My academic background in Computer Applications has given me a foundation in programming and problem-solving, which I now combine with my growing expertise in front-end development.</p>
        <h3>üîß Skills</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python (basic), SQLite</li>
          <li>MediaPipe (Virtual Trial Room project)</li>
          <li>Git & GitHub</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>üéØ Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I am passionate about combining creativity and technology to build intuitive digital 
          experiences. My main focus is front-end development, but I am always eager to learn 
          and explore beyond to grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outside of coding, I love exploring design trends and staying updated with new tools that make development faster and more efficient. I am particularly interested in how front-end development blends with user experience (UX) and accessibility, as I believe great websites should be inclusive for everyone. Looking ahead, I aspire to grow into a versatile developer who can work across both front-end and back-end technologies, contributing to impactful projects in the tech industry.</p>
